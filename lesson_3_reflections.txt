When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Any time you want to share your work! You could be sharing your work with the public, between computers, or working on it with partners.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might only want to have a stable or polished version of your code visable to the public.
If working as a team it might make sence to only push changes when they are ready to make the GitHub
repository easier to follow for your teammates.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are copies of repositories on GitHub that link back to a original repository.
Clones are direct copies of a repository. Branches are different veriation of code in a repository.
You would use forks to work on a copy of someone elses repositories that you do not have promition to change.
Clones are for ones that you do. Branches allow you to have different version of a repository you have access to.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can use the copy of the last know state to compare with diff to any changes you have made.
This can be useful to resoulve conflicts from having the changes to the remote banch after
you made your own changes.
