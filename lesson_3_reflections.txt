When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Any time you want to share your work! You could be sharing your work with the public, between computers, or working on it with partners.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might only want to have a stable or polished version of your code visable to the public.
If working as a team it might make sence to only push changes when they are ready to make the GitHub
repository easier to follow for your teammates.
